This repository is a complete collection of everything related to Jaider Aldana and Sebastian Molina's final project.

This project is a small application to manage patients and their diets, allowing CRUD operations for patients, dietitians, diet plans and meals. Although the data is handled in string format, it is suggested to integrate classes and create objects for each patient and diet, which would facilitate more complex calculations. It is important to note that the project works exclusively as a CRUD in CSV files and does not use a real database.
